Timestamp,Email Address,"Argument 1: The construction of hundreds of new coal plants abroad by China is being viewed with concern, as it appears to contradict the country's efforts to combat climate change. The decision to build these plants despite shutting major coal power plants domestically has raised questions about the consistency of China's climate change policies. It is noted that the increase in coal power capacity will be equivalent to the entire US coal fleet, which may undermine global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
