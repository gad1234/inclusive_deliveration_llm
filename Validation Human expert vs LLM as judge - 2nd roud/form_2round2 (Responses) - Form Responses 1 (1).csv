The social well-being of those affected highlights the importance of addressing climate change issues at a local level. As such, efforts to consult spirit mediums and witchdoctors for an explanation are seen as nonsensical by many who appreciate the effects and impact of climate change.

6/15/2025 17:07:19,mauro_rod12@hotmail.com,2,This is not a well formed argument based on the opinions. The only thing mentioned that is also in the opinions is the fact that human activity is a cause for climate change.,1,it does not say anything related to the opinions,"There has been a link between different kind of government and climate change. While many posit that socialism and leftism are the keys to solving this issue, mainly stating that the right answers to billionaires that only care about their own riches, there is also a great number of people who thinks that the link between socialism and climate change is only a political agenda only trying to get more votes. The ongoing fight for climate change now is portrayed also as a battle between socialism and capitalism and not just a fight for the common good.",2,This argument lacks information about the proposal for injecting sulfate aerosols into the atmosphere to fight climate change and the repercussions that such action could have on the environment.,3,"This argument also lacks information about the proposal made by China and the US, however it does state that aerosol emissions have contributed to global change.","It is widely acknowledged that human activity has dominated climate and environment, as evidenced by the significant impact of aerosol emissions on global warming. However, recent research highlights the role of natural phenomena in influencing climate change dynamics, challenging the dominant perception of human influence, such as the proposal made by China and the US to inject sulfate aerosols into the atmosphere to fight climate change. Further research is needed to calculate the impact this purpose could have on the environment in the short and long term.",2,"This does not entirely reflect the information in the opinions. While it correctly states that human activity is the main reason of climate change, it does not take into account the fact that this assumption is being challenged by many specialists and more research is needed to arrive to a definitive conclusion.",4,,,1,"This argument fails to account for the main piece of information in the opinions, namely Cyclone Idai and the devastation it caused. It does not mention this phenomena and does not say anything about the fact that government has to adress this issues in a serious manner.",4,,,1,This is just a repetition of the argument created in the previous prompts. It does not say anything of substance and does not take into account the information on the opinions.,4,,,4,,5,,,1,The connection between the shift of terminology and human activity being the driver in climate change is not clear and I would even say that there is no such connection.
