# Empowering Inclusive E-Deliberation by Harnessing Collective Wisdom and Minority Perspectives using AI and LLMs

This project seeks to enhance inclusive e-deliberation by developing AI tools that construct and explore stance and dialectic trees, empowering citizens and policymakers with structured insights into diverse perspectives for better decision-making and stronger social systems.

# About
This project aims to pragmatically contribute to inclusive e-deliberation by developing AI tools that facilitate this process, enabling citizens—not just experts or politicians—to be deeply involved in community problem-solving and public decision-making. Towards this end, it proposes the construction of stance trees, which are hierarchical structures representing the various stances on a particular topic.  By exploring stance trees, policymakers can gain a comprehensive and well-structured understanding of individual perspectives.
