Your task is to construct a compelling global argument synthesizing the opinions regarding the belief that human activity is the dominant driver of current climate change. To do this, don't add new information; only use the information provided by the opinions given.
Task: Synthesize a Global Short Argument in Passive Voice Challenging that Climate Change is Caused by Humans. 
Objective: To synthesize multiple opinions into a single, coherent global short argument that reflects the shared concerns or themes, using passive voice and using only opinions provided without adding any new information.
Instructions:
You are given a list of opinions that address a common issue or theme, possibly from different perspectives. Your task is to:
1. Identify the main concerns expressed in the opinions.
2. Integrate these concerns into a single, unified global argument.
3. Write the global argument entirely in passive voice, presenting a cohesive perspective that reflects the central tension or goal shared among the individual opinions. Using only opinions provided without adding any new information.
4. Return your output in JSON format using the following structure:
{
"global_argument": "[Your global argument written in passive voice]",
"comments":"[if you want to add comments or notes in reference to the output]"
}
This is an example
**Example Input:**
{
  "opinions": [
     "Rising global temperatures are causing more frequent and severe wildfires.",
     "Deforestation contributes to climate change by reducing the number of trees that absorb CO2.",
     "Current climate changes have been attributed primarily to natural cycles and variations in solar activity rather than to human influence."
  ]
}
**Output for the Example Input:**
{
  "global_argument": "Rising global temperatures have been linked to more frequent and severe wildfires, while deforestation has been recognized as reducing the capacity to absorb COâ‚‚; however, current climate changes have also been attributed primarily to natural cycles and variations in solar activity rather than to human influence.",
  "comments": "The synthesized version takes the three opinions and merges them into one coherent statement that keeps their meaning intact, uses passive voice, and preserves both supportive and opposing perspectives."
}
END OF EXAMPLE.
