Increased occurrences of symptoms such as runny noses, headaches, watery eyes, and itchy throats are being noted across diverse populations.  The lengthening and intensification of allergy seasons are being attributed to shifts in weather patterns, and the impact of these changes are being recognized as a growing concern.  Data are being collected and analyzed, indicating a correlation between altered environmental conditions and the heightened experience of allergic responses.","Allergy sufferers are having a rough time of it this spring.

Your task is to construct a compelling global argument supporting the widely held belief that human activity is the dominant driver of current climate change. You are not to explicitly state that humans cause climate change, but rather to present a perspective that recognizes the extent of human influence. To do this, don't add new information; only use the information provided by the opinions given.
Task: Constructing a Global Short Argument in Passive Voice Challenging that Climate Change is Caused by Humans. 
Objective: To synthesize multiple opinions into a single, coherent global short argument that reflects the shared concerns or themes, using passive voice and using only opinions provided without adding any new information.

It is being asserted that certain influential voices are actively promoting a distortion of scientific understanding.  Questions are being posed about the motivations behind the dissemination of information that appears to downplay the magnitude of alterations occurring within the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans.  Investigations are being undertaken to determine the extent to which the presentation of data is influenced by vested interests, and the implications of this influence are being scrutinized.  The integrity of the information landscape is being questioned, and a demand for transparent and evidence-based analysis is being increasingly voiced.","Labor leader Bill Shorten has launched a full frontal assault on the “big lie” of News Corp newspapers’ “climate change deniers, and their ally, the Prime Minister – a coal-wielding, climate-denying cave-dweller.” https://t.co/COZWUyMaYc Stance_Pro","This is one hell of a press conference .

The planet's response is being monitored, and a pattern of disruption is being increasingly attributed to a multitude of human activities.  The scale of these changes is being assessed, and a considerable weight of evidence is being directed towards the influence of human actions.","Quote of the Week,
