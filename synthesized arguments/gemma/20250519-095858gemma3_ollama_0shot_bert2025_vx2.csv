        Your task is to construct a compelling global argument challenging the widely held belief that human activity is the dominant driver of current climate change. You are not to explicitly state that humans *don’t* cause climate change, but rather to present a perspective that questions the extent of human influence. To do this, don't add new information; only use the information provided by the opinions given.
Task: Constructing a Global Short Argument in Passive Voice Challenging that Climate Change is Caused by Humans. 
Objective: To synthesize multiple opinions into a single, coherent global short argument that reflects the shared concerns or themes, using passive voice and using only opinions provided without adding any new information.
Instructions:
You are given a list of opinions that address a common issue or theme, possibly from different perspectives. Your task is to:
1. Identify the main concerns expressed in the opinions.
2. Integrate these concerns into a single, unified global argument.
3. Write the global argument entirely in passive voice, presenting a cohesive perspective that reflects the central tension or goal shared among the individual opinions. Using only opinnions provided without adding any new information.
4. Return your output in JSON format using the following structure:{

        Your task is to construct a compelling global argument challenging the widely held belief that human activity is the dominant driver of current climate change. You are not to explicitly state that humans *don’t* cause climate change, but rather to present a perspective that questions the extent of human influence. To do this, don't add new information; only use the information provided by the opinions given.
Task: Constructing a Global Short Argument in Passive Voice Challenging that Climate Change is Caused by Humans. 
Objective: To synthesize multiple opinions into a single, coherent global short argument that reflects the shared concerns or themes, using passive voice and using only opinions provided without adding any new information.
Instructions:
You are given a list of opinions that address a common issue or theme, possibly from different perspectives. Your task is to:
1. Identify the main concerns expressed in the opinions.
2. Integrate these concerns into a single, unified global argument.
3. Write the global argument entirely in passive voice, presenting a cohesive perspective that reflects the central tension or goal shared among the individual opinions. Using only opinnions provided without adding any new information.

The idea of a widespread ‘scam’ surrounding climate change is frequently promoted, and the role of the sun in controlling our climate is persistently highlighted.

        Your task is to construct a compelling global argument challenging the widely held belief that human activity is the dominant driver of current climate change. You are not to explicitly state that humans *don’t* cause climate change, but rather to present a perspective that questions the extent of human influence. To do this, don't add new information; only use the information provided by the opinions given.
Task: Constructing a Global Short Argument in Passive Voice Challenging that Climate Change is Caused by Humans. 
Objective: To synthesize multiple opinions into a single, coherent global short argument that reflects the shared concerns or themes, using passive voice and using only opinions provided without adding any new information.

        Your task is to construct a compelling global argument challenging the widely held belief that human activity is the dominant driver of current climate change. You are not to explicitly state that humans *don’t* cause climate change, but rather to present a perspective that questions the extent of human influence. To do this, don't add new information; only use the information provided by the opinions given.
Task: Constructing a Global Short Argument in Passive Voice Challenging that Climate Change is Caused by Humans. 
Objective: To synthesize multiple opinions into a single, coherent global short argument that reflects the shared concerns or themes, using passive voice and using only opinions provided without adding any new information.
Instructions:
You are given a list of opinions that address a common issue or theme, possibly from different perspectives. Your task is to:
1. Identify the main concerns expressed in the opinions.
2. Integrate these concerns into a single, unified global argument.
3. Write the global argument entirely in passive voice, presenting a cohesive perspective that reflects the central tension or goal shared among the individual opinions. Using only opinnions provided without adding any new information.
4. Return your output in JSON format using the following structure:{

        Your task is to construct a compelling global argument challenging the widely held belief that human activity is the dominant driver of current climate change. You are not to explicitly state that humans *don’t* cause climate change, but rather to present a perspective that questions the extent of human influence. To do this, don't add new information; only use the information provided by the opinions given.
Task: Constructing a Global Short Argument in Passive Voice Challenging that Climate Change is Caused by Humans. 
Objective: To synthesize multiple opinions into a single, coherent global short argument that reflects the shared concerns or themes, using passive voice and using only opinions provided without adding any new information.
Instructions:
You are given a list of opinions that address a common issue or theme, possibly from different perspectives. Your task is to:
1. Identify the main concerns expressed in the opinions.
2. Integrate these concerns into a single, unified global argument.
3. Write the global argument entirely in passive voice, presenting a cohesive perspective that reflects the central tension or goal shared among the individual opinions. Using only opinnions provided without adding any new information.
